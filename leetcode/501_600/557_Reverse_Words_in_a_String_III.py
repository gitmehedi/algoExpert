557. Reverse Words in a String III

Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.



Example 1:

Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Example 2:

Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s contains printable ASCII characters.
s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
There is at least one word in s.
All the words in s are separated by a single space.
